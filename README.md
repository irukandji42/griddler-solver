# griddler-solver
First Real Project

A griddler is a NP - Complete puzzle for which I am building a solver for. The goal is to practice the skills I have learned via my coding exercises and reading. For the time being it will remain a pure C++ project, but I will eventually add more layers to it to provide an interface as well as other functionality.
